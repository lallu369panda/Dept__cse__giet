# Deployment Guide

This CSE Department Portal can be deployed using multiple platforms. Here are the recommended deployment options:

## Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the best option as it's made by the Next.js team and supports all features including middleware.

### Steps to Deploy on Vercel:

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)** and sign up with your GitHub account
3. **Import your repository**: Click "New Project" â†’ Select your `Dept__cse__giet` repository
4. **Configure Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-key-here
   DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db
   ```
5. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app
6. **Domain**: Your app will be available at `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

### Automatic Deployments:
- Every push to `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment
- Preview deployments are created for pull requests

## Option 2: Railway

Railway is another excellent option that supports Node.js applications with databases.

### Steps to Deploy on Railway:

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign up with GitHub
2. **Create New Project** â†’ Deploy from GitHub â†’ Select your repository
3. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-key-here
   DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db
   ```
4. **Deploy**: Railway will build and deploy automatically

## Option 3: Netlify

Netlify is great for static sites and can handle Next.js applications.

### Steps to Deploy on Netlify:

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign up
2. **New site from Git** â†’ Choose your GitHub repository
3. **Build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
4. **Environment Variables**: Add the same variables as above
5. **Deploy**

## Environment Variables Needed:

For production deployment, you'll need these environment variables:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=a-very-long-random-string-at-least-32-characters
DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db
```

## Database Considerations:

Currently using SQLite (`dev.db`). For production, consider:

### Option A: Keep SQLite (Simple)
- Works well for small to medium applications
- No additional setup required
- File is included in deployment

### Option B: Upgrade to PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
- Better performance and scalability
- Use services like:
  - **Vercel Postgres** (if using Vercel)
  - **Railway PostgreSQL** (if using Railway)
  - **Supabase** (free tier available)
  - **PlanetScale** (MySQL alternative)

## GitHub Actions (Already Configured)

A GitHub Actions workflow is already set up in `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml` that will:
- âœ… Install dependencies
- âœ… Generate Prisma client
- âœ… Build the application
- âœ… Deploy to Vercel (when configured with secrets)
